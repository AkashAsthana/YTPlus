# YTPlus
## Description
Our project aims to take the user’s experience while using youtube to the next level. 
The main aim of the project is to allow friends to connect virtually to view videos together in sync with an embedded platform for chatting. 
Apart from this we also have included features to generate a text summary of the video and to skip to particular parts of the video using keywords, 
making it an application both suitable for fun and studies :)
